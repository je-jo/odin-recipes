# The Odin Project - Odin Recipes

This is a basic page done as a part of The Odin Project's new curriculum. I thought I should do these lessons because I'm a completist.

## Overview

### Description

The aim of this project was to understand the basics of HTML, with focus on links, images and lists.

### Links

- [Live Site](https://je-jo.github.io/odin-recipes/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### The process

This was an easy and relaxing project, seeing I've already done the old lessons. But this is my first multi-page "website".

### Future development

- Add styling.
- Use Dev Tools to "steal" the styling of The Odin Project site itself.

### Useful resources

- [allrecipes.com](http://www.allrecipes.com) - For the recipes :P
